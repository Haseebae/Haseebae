## 👋 Hi, I’m Haseeb Kollorath

I’m a **Research Staff Member at IISc DREAM Lab** and a Machine Learning Practitioner specializing in **Cloud Computing** and **Scalable Agentic Systems**. My work focuses on building infrastructure for **Massive Agent Interaction Workflows**, **Distributed Agent Architectures**, and **Hybrid Cloud Applications (XFaaS)**.

Previously at **Harman International (Samsung)**, I led initiatives in multi-agent frameworks and SecOps automation. I am deeply invested in bridging the gap between distributed systems and advanced AI, currently facilitating the training of large-scale language models on distributed clusters.
