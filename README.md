## 👋 Hi, I’m Haseeb Kollorath

I’m a **Research-focused ML Practitioner** and **Associate Data Scientist at Harman International** (Samsung). My work bridges the gap between **Autonomous Agent Systems**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Scalable MLOps**.

I specialize in architecting **multi-agent frameworks**, **cognitive planning systems**, and **fine-tuning VLMs/LLMs** for complex domain-specific tasks.

### 🚀 Current Role
**Associate Data Scientist – AI & ML Dept. @ Harman DTS** **Jan 2024 – Present**

* **Tech Lead (Gen-AI Invoice Processing):** Architected a multi-agent system with **Ray** (distributed computing) and **Prefect** (orchestration), achieving O(max) processing time via parallel execution. Fine-tuned **Qwen 2.5 VL** (3B) using QLora to achieve 78% F1-score.
* **Tech Lead (SecOps Copilot):** Developed an incident triaging agent integrating **Microsoft Sentinel** & **MISP**, reducing Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) by **40%**.
* **Research:** Investigating RL-based fine-tuning (GRPO, R-Zero) and cognitive frameworks (planning, memory) for autonomous agents.
* **Mentorship:** Conducting AI agent development sessions for 100+ engineers.
